Occupy Where?
-------------

This is a little app developed in a day for Box UK's hackday 'for the social good'.

It's more a bit of fun than actually socially useful in any way, but if it is able to inform people about the 'Occupy' movement, then that's something.

It's a bit rough around the edges; I'm particularly ashamed of the inline styles, but that reflects the fact that at 15 minutes to go before the deadline, the thing looked like crap.

Maybe I'll get round to tidying it up at some point. Or maybe someone else wants to do it? :)
